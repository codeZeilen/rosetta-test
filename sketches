When I write 'xy' to the file named 'foo.txt'
And I flush
Then stat on the directory includes the file 'foo.txt'

When I add 'video' to the groups of file 'foo.txt'
Then groups of the file 'foo.txt' contains 'video'

@Then("stat on the directory .... {}")
function statAssert(..) {
	result = stat(".");
	assert(result.includes(fileName));
}

@Then("groups of the file...")
function groupsAssert(..) {
	
}

@When("I write {content} to the file named {file_name}")
function writeContentStep(content, file_name) {
	fh = open(file_name, rw);
	fh.write(content);
}




(placeholder (open_file filname))
(placeholder (write_to_file content filename))
(placeholder (flush_file_system))
(placeholder (directory_stat directory_name))

...

(define open_write_close (content file_name) (
	))
	
(test stat (
	(let ((fh (open_file 'foo.txt'))
		(write_to_file 'xy' fh)
		(flush_file_system)
		(assert (contains 'foo.txt' (directory_stat '.')))))
